# Leaf Disease Detection

A machine learning-based project that detects and classifies leaf diseases from images using deep learning techniques. This project aims to help farmers and agriculturists identify plant diseases early and take preventive measures.

## Features
- Classifies multiple leaf diseases (e.g., early blight, late blight, leaf spot, etc.)
- User-friendly interface for uploading leaf images
- Accurate predictions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Real-time predictions supported

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Kaggle (dataset source)

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Contains thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves from various crops.
